No further development will be made on this project as the addon sdk is long gone, the new web-extensions will serve to make a close enough but not fully featured port as the apis needed are not there.

However I'm gonna start testing a draft spec that will simplify some functionality that i was working on before the deprecation of the extensions SDK, if all is as good as it seems a new, yet similar, extension will be made around it, probably on his own repository as it'll have a new codebase.
